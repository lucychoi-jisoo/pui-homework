        <p class="description">
          Talabat is an online food and grocery delivery platform that operates in 7 countries: Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Jordan, and Egypt, with over 13,000 restaurants and stores and 24,000 branches.
          In 2020, Talabat introduced Talabat mart, a darkstore which fulfilled users‚Äô grocery needs online. It successfully positioned itself as a leading online grocery platform with its quick delivery (20 minutes), addressing users‚Äô impulse purchases.
          However, based on the report from Nielsen on the UAE market, impulse purchases accounted for only 26% of total online grocery shopping. Therefore, not focusing on weekly or monthly needs directly corresponded to reducing Talabat‚Äôs total addressable market by 74%.

      <div class="projectDescription">
        <p class="title">Challenge</p>
        <p class="description">
          Talabat's grocery vertical needed to reposition the value proposition of their service from catering for impulse purchases with its quick delivery, to something that offered the business higher long-term value.
          So, we asked:
          HMW inspire users to fulfill their grocery needs beyond their impulse purchases?

        <p>My intuition told me that Facebook group page wasn‚Äôt catered to the specifics of NYUAD campus students</p>
        <h2>But what if people didn‚Äôt find it a problem?</h2>
        <p>
          Screener survey helped me get insights to user experience from people who fit the precise criteria I had designed:
          ‚ú¥ Students who have had experience buying and/or selling products on ‚ÄúFemale RoR‚Äù in the last year ‚ú¥ Students who use mobile phones to buy and/or sell products on ‚ÄúFemale RoR‚Äù ‚ú¥ Students who have had neutral to very inconvenient online experiences buying and/or selling products on ‚ÄúFemale RoR‚Äù.
          Based on the interview, it seemed like there were a couple of problems I could solve.
          I categorized key insights mainly into problems and things to maintain as there were still some aspects that people have gotten accustomed to and enjoyed, something that I wanted to preserve in my solution.

        <p>From the interview, it was quite clear...</p>
        <h2>Both the sellers and buyers needed a quick and efficient process to cater for their busy schedule</h2>
        <p>
          Key areas of opportunities for the buyers based on the insights were:
          ‚ú¥ To give transparency on the waitlist (eg. live update of the status of items and etc) ‚ú¥ Have important information about the product by the seller to minimize back and forth communication

      <div class="descriptionText">
        <p>
          Key areas of opportunities for the sellers based on the insights were:
          ‚ú¥ To automate some manual processes when it comes to contacting the interested buyers ‚ú¥ To remove unnecessary steps such as the admin approval process for posts and edits
        </p>

        <p>Digging deeper...</p>
        <h2>Sellers had to go an infinite loop of updating and contacting the potential buyers until their items were sold</h2>

    <div id="hypothesis" data-aos="fade-up">
      <div class="descriptionText">
        <p>Based on my secondary research, I was able to deduce that</p>
        <h2>People in group pages had higher purchase intentions than those who were not.</h2>
        <p>
          With a total of 75.5% of Facebook users who have joined commercial groups or fan pages, most of them tended to have higher purchase intention than those who were not in such groups.
          A total of 10.3% of the users who joined commercial groups tended to be affected by their Facebook friends and other users‚Äô response behavior toward posts in the groups.
        </p>

        <p>Hypothesis</p>
        <p>
          ‚ú¥ The design solution that is optimized for NYUAD‚Äôs female-identifying students will increase the engagement level on the app, and lead to higher levels of sustainable purchases on campus.
          ‚ú¥ Having a separate platform for campus e-commerce will gather interested users on one platform and remove distractions on ‚ÄúFemale RoR‚Äù.
          ‚ú¥ Positive experiences from the existing users will promote the app and expand the usage boundary to potential users who have not sold or bought secondhand products on campus (43% of survey participants did not have any experience buying and selling on ‚ÄúFemale RoR‚Äù).

    <div id="designProcess" data-aos="fade-up">
      <p>With less ambiguity and more conviction,</p>
      <h2>It was time to... DESIGN üöÄ</h2>
      <p>
        Having to design an end-to-end experience from scratch, starting on paper helped me declutter ideas in my head and objectively critique the usability of my design.

          Even without proper content, users were able to execute the tasks, and it was time to polish my design and make it better for testing. The final prototype included a variety of high-fidelity animations to help users navigate through the app.
