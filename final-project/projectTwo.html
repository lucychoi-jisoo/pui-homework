        <p class = "description">
            This project explores how to empower everyday users to detect harmful behaviors in generative AI systems. While industry teams often miss emergent biases due to cultural blindspots or unanticipated social contexts, regular users can identify issues through their day-to-day interactions, as seen in cases like Twitter’s biased image-cropping algorithm. By leveraging "everyday algorithm auditing," this project aims to harness the collective insights of diverse users to uncover biases in systems like ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion and provide actionable feedback for AI/ML teams. The goal is to design effective intervention methods to maximize the impact of user-driven audits.

        <p class="title"> Challenge</p>
        <p class = "description"> 
            Based on our research, we identified that users often struggle to fully trust generative AI due to concerns about biased responses and the use of unreliable primary sources. Despite this skepticism, users primarily turn to generative AI for its ability to save time and energy by automating tedious tasks such as proofreading. However, generative AI is frequently perceived as a tool associated with "cheating," which creates stigma and limits open discussions about its use, particularly in classroom settings. We sought to understand how this stigma can be reframed into an opportunity to foster open discussions about generative AI.

    <h2>Working in Teams</h2>
    <p>
        Before the project, I strongly agreed that working in teams was beneficial to my learning. After the experience, I still strongly agree, but I’ve realized that the effectiveness of teamwork depends on how well the team can bounce ideas off one another and build collaboratively. During the reframing exercise, I learned to take on a leadership role when I felt the research question was becoming repetitive. I scheduled a follow-up meeting to walk the team through my thought process and persuaded them to explore a very different research direction. This experience taught me the value of balancing roles as both a team member and a leader, adapting as needed to help the group move forward productively.
        </p>

    <h2>    Providing Feedback to Peers</h2>
     <p>   Before the project, I was only slightly comfortable providing feedback to my peers, and this hasn’t changed much. However, the experience taught me a lot about delivering feedback in a constructive way, even in challenging circumstances. At one point, I needed to address a team member’s performance to ensure we met our goals. It was tough because I didn’t know if they were dealing with personal challenges outside of the course. I tried to remove emotions from the conversation and focused on the improvements needed for the team’s success. Although it wasn’t easy, providing feedback on behalf of the team helped me grow in navigating sensitive situations and communicating with clarity and empathy.
    </p>
     <h2>  Taking Risks</h2> 
     <p>  My comfort level with taking risks in projects remained consistent, as I still feel hesitant to take risks when working in a team. This hesitation stems from the responsibility I feel for the group’s overall performance and the recognition that everyone has other commitments. If this had been an individual project, I might have been more willing to take risks. However, in this context, we focused on pursuing creative ideas we felt confident in, ensuring they weren’t repetitive while minimizing the chance of setbacks that could disrupt the team’s alignment. This approach taught me how to balance creativity with practicality when working collaboratively.
        
        In summary, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me refine my ability to lead, give feedback, and navigate challenges within a team setting. It highlighted the importance of flexibility, communication, and balancing risk with responsibility when working with others.</p>

    <h2> Was I able to fulfill my learning objectives?</h2>
    <p> 1. Growing Confidence as a Product Designer Through Research Insights</p>
       <p> My goal was to grow more confident in my designs by leveraging various, applicable research insights. During this project, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in methods like rapid prototyping, parallel prototyping, and speed dating—approaches I hadn’t often used in my previous company. I realized the value of generating a large volume of incomplete or partial ideas and quickly learning from them. This process helped me appreciate how exploration and iteration can drive innovation. However, since the project leaned more heavily on research, I didn’t get as much of an opportunity to hone my design execution skills.</p>
    
        <p> 2. Leading a Team and Guiding Through Ambiguity</p>
          <p>  I wanted to become more comfortable leading a project with a group of people, particularly in navigating ambiguity using various research methods. I had the chance to do this during the reframing exercise, especially in the early to mid stages of the project. I felt like I was mentoring team members who didn’t have as much experience, drawing on my own knowledge to help guide them. A big focus for me was finding the balance between mentoring and sounding condescending. I worked on improving the way I communicated feedback and insights, ensuring my delivery was collaborative and supportive. This helped me grow as a leader.</p>
    
        <p>3. Expanding Beyond User Interviews in Research Methods</p>
         <p>  I wanted to learn research methods that went beyond standard user interviews, and this project gave me plenty of opportunities to do so. I learned methods like parallel prototyping, contextual inquiry, and insight synthesis exercises, including abstraction ladders and creating user personas. These tools added depth to my research toolkit and broadened my understanding of how to uncover and structure insights in creative ways.</p>

    <h2> What did I bring to the table?</h2>
    <p>
        It can be challenging to think outside the box especially when there are defined sets of deliverables throughout the project deadline. Utilizing my insights from my previous work experience, I was able to understand the bigger picture of what the project entails, for example, reframing the problem statement outside of simply chat GPT and WeAudit as I knew this would be covered by many of our peers. Understanding the bigger picture and connecting the dots between the insights we got from previous secondary research through Walk the Wall activity, I knew that college students have the most potential to report if given the right incentive because our research revealed that they already have some kind of distrust with the responses chat gpt gives, and tend to cross-check information on google search. This helped us pivot away from a standard idea and expand our thinking beyond a digital space into a physical setting- classroom.
